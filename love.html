<h1>Words I Never Said Before</h1>

<p>
There are many things in my heart that I want to tell you.  
Sometimes words feel too small to express what I feel for you.<br><br>

I love you very deeply.  
You are my first love.  
No matter where life takes us, you will always be very special to me.<br><br>

I don’t know what destiny has planned for your future.  
I don’t know whom you will marry one day.  
But I truly wish that I will always have a small place in your heart.  
Because in my heart, you are not just special… you are the person who touched my soul.<br><br>

I love your voice so much.  
I can listen to it forever.  
Whenever you are teaching and asking me why I am not focusing, the truth is… I get lost in your voice.  
I go into my own imaginary world.  
That is why I lose focus sometimes.<br><br>

I know I irritate you many times.  
Sometimes I behave childish and trouble you.  
Thank you for always being patient with me and tolerating me with kindness.<br><br>

When you call me “baby”, I cannot explain that feeling.  
My heart becomes very happy.  
Even when you call me “idiot”, it makes me smile.  
You changed me from a sincere girl into a romantic girl.<br><br>

I don’t know whether my feelings are right or wrong.  
But in my dreams, I imagine you as my life partner.  
Whenever you don’t reply to me, I feel scared and restless.  
Sometimes I cannot sleep because I keep thinking about you.<br><br>

I have one fear in my heart.  
That one day you might leave me.  
Even if life changes, I want you to stay in my life at least as a friend until my last breath.  
Please don’t break this bond.<br><br>

I truly admire your maturity. The way you think, understand situations,
 and handle things calmly makes me respect you a lot. 
 It gives me a sense of comfort and trust that I cannot easily explain.<br><br>

When I look at you, I don’t see just one person.  
I see many beautiful relationships in you.<br><br>

You guide me when I am confused.  
You care for me when I feel weak.  
You comfort me when I am emotional.  
You support me like a life partner in my dreams.  
Sometimes you behave like a child and make me smile.<br><br>

You have given me love, care, happiness, and comfort.  
I don’t need anything more than this.<br><br>

All I want is you to stay in my life.  
Stay in my heart.  
Stay in my memories forever.<br><br>

I love you… today, tomorrow, and always… forever ❤️<br><br>

(Please don’t ever stop talking to me 🥺💖<br>
If I make mistakes, gently guide me 🙏✨<br>
Losing your attention or silence feels heavier than any punishment 😔💔<br>
I just want to stay close to you forever 🫂💞)<br>
