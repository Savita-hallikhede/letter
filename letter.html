<h1>Read Carefully!</h1>

<p>
First of all, thank you for coming into my life.<br><br>

There is something I want to tell you. Before you came into my life, I always believed that I would never fall for someone. I used to think that no one would ever reach my heart. But you changed that completely.<br><br>

The most important people in my life have always been my family. They hold a very special place in my heart, and I never imagined anyone else could be a part of that space. But you came into my life and slowly became someone who deserves that special place too.<br><br>

These days, I sometimes realize that I talk to you more than I talk to my family. When I thought deeply about why this is happening, I understood something beautiful. It is not because of physical appearance or looks. I felt connected to you because of your behavior, your way of talking, teaching, respecting others, your humor, your caring and helping nature.<br><br>

All these qualities made me start liking you. I don’t know when or how this happened, but I know it is very special to me.<br><br>

I like you not only for your good side, but also for your flaws. I accept both, because that is what makes you, you.<br><br>

Trusting someone blindly is something I have never done before. But with you, it happened naturally, without fear, without hesitation.<br><br>

And that is how special you are to me ❤️
